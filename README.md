For the Unit 5 IP:

- the new HTML file is 'views/products.html'
- the new JavaScript file is 'js/products.js'
- the new CSS file is 'css/products.css'

I have a live link that is available at: https://elegant-jepsen-b68e31.netlify.com/

It is using the live code at: https://github.com/cushmatt/Audio

It's funny because the first JavaScript page we did where I dynamically load the
Microphone's names, images, prices, and descriptions, I hadn't realized that I was
using Ajax with that page as well. So technically that page completes this assignment
as well.

Thank You! I appreciate the class, had a ton of fun making things. Only wish I had more time to do my assignments so I could've put more design work into some of them like this Unit.
